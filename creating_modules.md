To create a new Odoo module, you need to follow a few fundamental steps. The process involves setting up the basic structure and defining the module's purpose through its manifest file.

Here's how to create a new module:

- **Prepare the addon directory:** First, you need to create a new directory within your specified addons path. For example, if you're following the tutorials, you might create a directory named `estate` within a `tutorials` directory. The addons path is where the Odoo server looks for modules. You can specify multiple module directories using the `--addons-path` option when starting the Odoo server.

- **Create essential files:** A module must contain at least two files: `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py`.

  - The `__init__.py` file can initially be empty but is necessary for Odoo to recognize the module as a Python package. It typically contains import instructions for the Python files within the module.
  - The `__manifest__.py` file describes your module and is crucial. It must contain at least the `name` of the module and usually includes other information such as `category`, `summary`, `website`, and most importantly, its `depends` list, which specifies other modules that must be installed before your module. For a minimal setup, your module will likely depend on the `base` module. You can also mark your module as an 'App' by adding the `"application": True` key to the `__manifest__.py`. Data files, including XML and CSV files that define views, data, and security rules, are also declared in the manifest under the `data` and `demo` keys.

- **Define business objects (models):** To store data, you need to define business objects as Python classes that inherit from `models.Model`. These model definitions are typically located in a `models` subdirectory, with each model in its own Python file, which is then imported in `models/__init__.py` and subsequently in the main module's `__init__.py`. The most important attribute of a model is `_name`, which defines the unique identifier of the model within the Odoo system.

Regarding how the **database name and table are created**:

- **Database Name:** The database name is specified when you create or select a database to work with in Odoo. When you start the Odoo server, you can use the `-d` command-line option followed by the database name to target a specific database. For example, `./odoo-bin -d your_database_name`.

- **Table Creation:** When you define a new Odoo model with the `_name` attribute, Odoo's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) automatically creates a corresponding table in the PostgreSQL database. The name of the database table is typically derived from the `_name` of the model. For instance, a model with `_name = 'estate.property'` will result in a database table named `estate_property`. The fields you define in your Python model class as attributes (using `fields` from the `odoo` module) are automatically mapped to columns in this database table. Odoo supports various field types, which correspond to different SQL data types.

  For modules created entirely using XML data files (importable or data modules), models are defined as records in the `ir.model` model, and fields are defined as records in the `ir.model.fields` model. These definitions, typically prefixed with `x_` to differentiate them from Python-defined models and fields, also instruct the ORM to create the corresponding database tables and columns when the module is installed.

Regarding **reload commands**:

Several command-line options are used to reload modules and apply changes:

- **`-u <module_name>` (Update/Upgrade):** This option is used to update or upgrade a specific module (or a comma-separated list of modules) on the database specified by the `-d` option. When you create a new module or make changes to your model definitions (e.g., adding fields, constraints), you need to restart the Odoo server with the `-u` option followed by your module's technical name (the name used in the `_name` attribute and the module's directory name) to apply these changes to the database. For example, `./odoo-bin -d your_database_name -u estate`. This command tells the ORM to compare the current state of the models in your module with the database schema and apply any necessary alterations, such as creating new tables, adding columns, or modifying constraints.

- **`--dev xml`:** When developing views (XML files), you can use the `--dev xml` parameter along with `-u` and `-d` when launching the server. This allows you to see the changes you make to your view definitions by simply refreshing your browser, without needing to restart the entire server each time. For example, `./odoo-bin -d your_database_name -u estate --dev xml`.

- **Updating the Apps List:** In the Odoo web interface, especially when you've added a new module to your addons path, you need to update the list of available apps. With developer mode enabled, you can click on "Update Apps List" in the Apps menu. This makes Odoo aware of the new modules present in your addons path so you can then install them.

- **Module Installation:** After Odoo recognizes your module (via updating the apps list), you need to install it. This process triggers the loading of the module's data files (including model definitions if it's a data module), the creation of the corresponding database tables, and the setup of any initial data, views, and access rights.

- **Module Uninstallation and Reinstallation:** If you make significant changes, especially to model definitions, sometimes it's necessary to uninstall the module first and then reinstall it to ensure all changes are correctly applied in the database.

- **Deploying Data Modules:** For modules created as importable data modules (using only XML), you create a zip file of the module and upload it via the "Apps > Import Module" menu (developer mode required). Modifying and re-uploading such a module will reload its data. The import wizard might offer options like "Force init" to update data marked with `noupdate="1"`.

In summary, creating a new module involves setting up a directory structure with `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py` files, defining your business logic in Python files (including model definitions), and potentially creating XML files for views and data. The ORM automatically handles the creation of database tables based on your model definitions. The `-u` command is essential for applying changes to your models in the database, while `--dev xml` can speed up view development. Updating the apps list and installing the module are necessary steps to integrate your new module into your Odoo instance.
